Kenza Moderation is a Free-To-Use Roblox Moderation System Only.

Unlike other Admin Commands in the ROBLOX World, Kenza-Moderation only has Moderational Commands which means, yes it has a short amount of commands, it is just as effective.

Kenza Moderation is an amazing tool for Roblox Developers to use that only wants their Staff to work professionaly without the worry of them using extra commands.

We attempt to add 2 new commands every 2 weeks to ensure the quality of Kenza Moderation.

Kenza Moderation is controlled by Extraordinary Midnight Studios.

We are taking suggestions in the Extraordiary Midnight Studios Discord Server which can be found on the Studio Group Page!
